# Social-Bites

Social Bites is a capstone project worked on by me and three great collaborators. The source is forked from the original repo, where most of the work was done. We have since decided to separate our versions of the repo, but you can still find the original in the fork link. You can find this project deployed on https://social-bites.com/ for demonstration purposes only. The concept is a social media-esque site for restaurants and users to come together for events, deals, and honest reviews. This project was built over the course of about 3 weeks, and thought parts may seem slightly off, I feel we have done pretty well for being very new to web development. It can certainly use some polishing at a later date.

## Stack

This project uses the PERN stack, consisting of PostgreSQL, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js. We also use old pals, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The react project is initialized with Vite. This site was deployed using AWS Windows and Apache Lounge.
For APIs, only Google Maps API was used, with a few minor extensions, such as their Directions API. 

## Installing on your own machine

This section will be improved on shortly as it requires PostgreSQL instructions and special extensions in addition to your average `npm install` commands. 

## Improvements to be made (Maybe? Possibly?)

A list of things I've been considering continuing on my own:

- Adding email confirmation and verification
- Fixing styles on basic pages (e.g. FAQ, About Us...)
- Experimenting with mobile-friendliness
- OpenAI integration for suggestion-optimization
- Improving efficiency as SPAs are not exactly known for their speed
- Implementing a real-time messaging system, possibly with socket.io

These are not priority or set in stone, but at the point of returning to this project, I'd want to experiment with the lengths this project can go. Or I can start that Travel Log I've been thinking about; Who knows!
